AIM: Scan Python scripts for vulnerabilities, bugs, and other traits using SonarQube

**What is SonarQube:**

SonarQube is an automatic code review tool to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells in your code. It can integrate with your existing workflow to enable continuous code inspection across your project branches and pull requests.

SonarQube is a Code Quality Assurance tool that collects and analyzes source code and provides reports for the code quality of your project. It combines static and dynamic analysis tools and enables quality to be measured continually over time. Everything from minor styling choices to design errors are inspected and evaluated by SonarQube. This provides users with a rich searchable history of the code to analyze where the code is messing up and determine whether or not it is styling issues, code defeats, code duplication, lack of test coverage, or excessively complex code. 

SonarQube also ensures code reliability, Application security, and reduces technical debt by making your code base clean and maintainable. SonarQube also provides support for 27 different languages, including C, C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, GO, Python, and much more. SonarQube also provides CI/CD integration and gives feedback during code review with branch analysis and pull request decoration.
